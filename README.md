# Web Game : Dino Dash

This is the git repository for the web game Dino Dash! The game takes full inspiration from the Google Chrome Offline Dino game. It implements an endless sequence of
obstacles that are thrown towards the players way. There are 2 obstacles; one which the player has to jump over, and another which you will duck under. This is a feature
that's not part of the chrome game - the duck feature! It allows for more intensive gameplay interest and keeps a player more engaged. 

The game is made to look like a more modern web game, utilizing different menus and models, while also including leaderboards; Here, a player's highscores will be saved
and displayed on a database for everyone to see. This will indefinitely encourage players to play more and try to improve their scores!

# How to Play:

Playing the game is fairly simple. There are only 2 controls for the dino:
  - Jump - W, Up Arrow Key, Spacebar
  - Duck - S, Down Arrow Key
  
Different buttons have also been added to the game to access different menus and allow for a more interactive experience.
